<h1>7 Most Disturbing Films</h1>
<p>It is a well-known fact from society that we watch films to have some fun. Especially when we want to explore the morbid curiosity of human nature. Here are the 7 most disturbing films to watch.</p>
<h1>1. Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975). </h1>
<p>The movie focuses in the physical, mental and sexual torture of young boys and girls from fascist libertines in World War 2 Italy. This movie subjects a hard view of human cruelty and is essential to be seen but impossible to watch, because a watcher may find life somehow defiled for the fact that these kind of stuff can be easily imagined.</p>

<h1>2. Antichrist (2009). </h1>

style="width:600px;height:300px;">
<p>Lars Von Trier never was exactly an optimist but this piece of art was a total pessimistic one. It is visually atmospheric, I sometimes found it creepy and you would see more of Willem Dafoe. 
    I find it hard to analyze with words.

<h1>3. Gummo (1997).</h1>
<img src="gummo.bmp"
style="width:600px;height:300px;">
<p>When I first watched this film I honestly had no idea what it was supposed to mean. Movie subjects the people of a small town trying to make meaning in their unfulfilled, boring lives.
    <br> The people are isolated from the outside world and revolve around playing, it is really interesting to see the world from this kind of perspective. And after all, does a film has to have a point?

<h1>4. The Human Centipede (2009).</h1>
<img src="centipede.bmp"
style="width:600px;height:300px;">
<p>Okay, wait a second, what the hell?! The story focuses on a surgeon that sutures three people together through their gastric systems. It has a dark humour from time to time and I'd say it is a total psychologically nastiness. And this has two more sequels which the second is more disturbing.</p>

</p>
<h1>5. Taxidermia (2006).</h1>
<img src="taxidermia.bmp"
style="width:500px;height:301px;">
<p>This is an exploration of the bizarre of three generations of men, including a pervert of new satisfactions, an obese eater and a passionate embalmer. <br> It's totally well-shot and well-acted, especially Marc Bischoff. I liked the plot and I thought it was unique, even though disgusting in some parts. What I find it weird about this film is that it is supposed to be a representation of the political history of Hungary.</p>

<h1>6. Nekromantik (1987) </h1>
<img src="nekromantik.bmp"
style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<p>This is a mix of gore and animal maiming and the finale left me very shocking. It has been banned from a lot of countires until today, but it gained a good status. <br>The film is about a man that brings home a corpse for himself and his wife to enjoy it sexually. </p>

</p>

<h1>7. Audition (1999).</h1>
<img src="audition.bmp"
style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<p>This is a Japanese psychologically disturbing tale of a man that struggles to find the perfect wife. It has some psychotically disgusting images and it was so much more than I expected, being though so hard to watch.
 Do not watch it in the presence of someone that does not know about bizarre sadomasochistic gore and violence.</p>
